/**
 * An exception is an event which occurs during the execution of a program
 * that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions.
 *
 * <p>Valid Java code must honor the <i>Catch or Specify Requirement (CSR)</i>.
 * This means that code that might throw certain exceptions must be enclosed by either of the following:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>a try statement that catches the exception
 *         (the try must provide a handler for the exception)</li>
 *     <li>a method that specifies that it can throw the exception
 *         (the method must provide a throws clause that lists the exception)</li>
 * </ul>
 * <i>Note</i>: not all exceptions are subject to the <i>CSR</i>
 *
 * <p>The following three kinds/categories of exceptions are considered:
 * <ul>
 *     <li><em>checked exceptions</em> (are subject to the CSR) - exceptional conditions that a well-written application
 *         should anticipate and recover from</li>
 *     <li><em>unchecked exceptions</em> (are not subject to the CSR) - exceptional conditions that the application
 *         usually cannot anticipate or recover from, namely:
 *     <ul>
 *         <li><em>errors</em> - exceptional conditions that are external to the application</li>
 *         <li><em>runtime exceptions</em> - exceptional conditions that are internal to the application;
 *             these usually indicate programming bugs</li>
 *     </ul>
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 *
