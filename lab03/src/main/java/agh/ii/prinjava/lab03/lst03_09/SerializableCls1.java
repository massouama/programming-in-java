/**
 * <i>Serialization</i> - a process/mechanism of converting object's state along with its class information
 * into a byte stream (sequence of bytes), as well as the process of rebuilding those bytes into
 * a live object at some future time (often called <i>deserialization</i>).
 *
 * <p>Note: serialization used to be important, but in contemporary applications is not used very often
 *
 * <p>{@link Serializable} is only a marker interface - it simply allows the serialization mechanism to verify
 * that the class can be persisted
